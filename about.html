	    <h2>About me</h2>

	    <p>Originally from the <em>Cincinnati</em> area, I lived in <em>Vienna</em>,
	      Austria for a long while, currently reside in beautiful
	      <em>Baltimore</em>, and call <em>Chicago</em> my honorary fourth home.</p>

	    <p>There's almost nothing I like more than a good novel, but
	      a well-executed bit of problem solving comes close. I've
	      always liked math, but, perhaps oddly, it always played
	      second fiddle to a series of primary interests: physics,
	      finance, economics, computational biology, and now this
	      whole "data science" thing. <em>If only I could do everything,
		and be everywhere...</em></p>

	    <h2>On data science</h2>
	    <p>
	      <em>There's not a huge difference between fiction and
		data science.</em> They both take roundabout paths strewn
	      with dialectic encounters and flowery&mdash;if
	      incomprehenisble&mdash;language, but they <em>both are capable of
		leading us to truths that nothing else can find.</em>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      If you stumble sideways into one of the great truths of
	      fiction or data science, it's not because you're lucky; it's
	      because your preparation taught you how to recognize
	      something meaningful. That doesn't happen if you don't know
	      the canon. I take pride in knowing my <em>Anna Karenina</em> and my
	      <em>Bayesian Data Analysis</em>.
	    </p>


	    <h2>Some fun things I've done:</h2>

	    <p>That time I did a probabilistic analysis of world records
	      and elite performances in track and
	      field, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5924">was
		published</a> right before the 2012 Olympic Games and was
	      interviewed and quoted in
	      <a href="http://www.insidescience.org/content/mathematical-view-track-and-field-world-records/755">two
		articles</a>
	      on <a href="http://www.insidescience.org/blog/2012/08/02/more-world-record-science">insidescience.org</a>.</p>

	    <p>The time I presented
	      at <a href="http://datacommunitydc.org/blog/2013/08/data-science-md-july-recap-python-and-r-meetup/">a
		Data Science MD Meetup</a> in Baltimore, and someone
	      took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le6f1UqzSHY&index=2&list=PLgqwinaq-u-Piu9tTz58e7-5IwYX_e6gh">a
		video.</a></p>

	    <p>Those times I set world records in backwards running,
	      <a href="http://www.muredhawks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=26100&ATCLID=205457203">first
		at 800m</a>, then
	      at <a href="http://www.retrorunning.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=112:tolle-shwo-in-nussloch&catid=19&Itemid=107">3000m
		and 5000m</a> in a single run (article in German). My arch
	      nemesis has since broken two of them a couple of
	      times. Current world records for backwards
	      running <a href="http://www.recordholders.org/en/list/backwards-running.html">are
		here</a>.</p>

	    <p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/14/AR2006011400792.html">Washington
		Post article</a> about me having "turned around [my] running
	      career".</p>

	    <p>Those times when I ran forwards and was
	      actually <a href="https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/bgod13/Profile">pretty
		good at it</a>. Also that absolutely perfect day in high
	      school when I won a state championship for
	      the <a href="http://www.ohsaa.org/sports/cc/boys/1998/1998bd1cc.htm">second
		time</a>.</p>

	    <p>When I won a hard-fought Celtic Solstice 5-miler wearing
	      spikes in a road race during the first Baltimore blizzard in
	      December of '09. I cross the finish line at 3:27 in
	      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etQ6qCBlqB8">this
		video</a>, but that's nowhere near the best part.</p>

	    <p>That time I was
	      a <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bal-godsey-glimpsed-work-20130412-photo.html">style
		icon</a>.</p>

	    <p>In March 2014, when my
	      name <a href="http://www.runningisfunny.com/2014/03/20/funny-running-in-jeopardy/">appeared
		in a clue</a> on Jeopardy, because of running backwards, of
	      course.</p>
